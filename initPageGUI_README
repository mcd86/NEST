All that I have so far for the init page gui is posted here.  When it's finished it will look much nicer, so ignore the purple boarders.
Also, you can ignore the stuff at the bottom of the layout.xml (the countries and business type spinner), those were form playing around with the spinners and I'll eventually remove them.
SO far this asks for class name, building name, days of week and I will soon add time, and I just remebered I need to add room number as well.
The building names string that appears with the building spinner doesn't have all the building names in there yet, but ive added a bunch and I'll add more soon too (including the buildings on the center city campus).
